main.py contains a solver for boggle found on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/, modified to work on sanalouhos with the entire finnish dictionary. Searches for matrix combinations of adjacent elements in the dictionary

second.py removes all words from the dictionary that cannot be considered as solutions and then searches for words from dictionary in the sanalouhos matrix. Much faster than main.py
